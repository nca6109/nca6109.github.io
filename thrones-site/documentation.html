        <h1>Project 2 "A Song of Ice and Fire" Documentation</h1>
        <p>
            My website is made from an API that I chose myself. I found an API called "An API of Ice and Fire" (linked down below) that had information from the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> book series. My idea for this site was to have a home page that was an interactive map of the world that would give you information about major players in it; additionally, there would be three other pages on the site where the user could search through the different libraries available from the API. <br>The site can be controlled by clicking on the navbar at the top to navigate through different pages, clicking on symbols on the map, and using the search functions on each distinct library page. The home/map page has two separate controls that change the map and bring up info popups when clicked on. Each library has a search by name control, as well as a paginated "view all" search option and a paginated region or culture specific search. The colors of the website are based on the color palatte used in art from the <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV show. The page clearly shows the user what is clickable and lets the user know what stage the page is in. <br>I put a lot of heart into this project and I feel that it goes far beyond what we learned in the GIPHY Finder project. I think that this project deserves an A for its variety of content, generally pleasing graphic design, and robust integration of its API.
