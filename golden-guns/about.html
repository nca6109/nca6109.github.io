        <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
        <p>A Rock-Paper-Scissors style game when you shoot, block, or reload to defeat your opponent.</p>
        <h2>II. Genre</h2>
        <p><em>Golden Guns</em> is an action-arcade game</p>
        <h2>III. Platform</h2>
        <p>Desktop web</p>
        <h2>IV. Story</h2>
        <p>Duel your way through different fighters and take their special cards to become the Golden Gun Duelist.</p>
        <h2>V. Aestetics</h2>
        <p>The game's graphics style is pixel art and simple. Sound effects of the game will be slapstick style and there will be a looping western style theme in the background of the game.</p>
        <h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Mechanics</b>: The basic gameplay loop will involve a planning and action phase. In the planning phase, the player will choose whether to shoot their gun, reload their gun, dodge the incoming shot, or play a card from their hand. The player hand will always consist of two cards and there is a deck of cards that automatically deal onto the hand when one is used. In the action phase, the player and opponent's actions will clash and will interact accordinly.</li>
            <li><b>Control</b>: Game is controlled by mouse and involves clicking buttons/icons to make decisions and advance turns. Keyoard may be used to enter player name.</li>
            <li><b>Teaching the Game</b>: The controls of the game are very simple so text will be displayed at the start of the game to explain how to play. For teaching what cards do, the player can hover their mouse over the card and a flaoting text box will appear to show what the card does.</li>
            <li><b>Player Learning</b>:The main thing that the player will need to learn to win the game is the optimal strategy to deal with each opponent. The AI for each opponent will be slightly different, for example, one may primarily dodge while another may attack at every given opportunity. The player will need to learn the habits of the different duelists and use their tools properly to defeat them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>VIII. Development Process</h2>
        <p>I think that I was ambitious with all the hats I wanted to wear for this game. Besides, being the only developer and designer, I also wanted to create assets and score background music for the game. Unfortunately, other schoolwork kept me from starting heavy work on this project early so I was unable to fill all the roles I wanted to. Early on I decided to find cowboy sprites, but sadly it was not until the dayy before it was due that I accepted that I did not have time to compose a score and get all of the more important delieverables in on time. Every feature I wanted to add to the game got included and I am very happy about that. Starting off by creating the skeleton of "Golden Guns" made developing further a much better experience because I knew no matter what, there was a game to show.</p>
        <p><b>Tips:</b> I advise saving your cards for the later opponents, they are more random than the first pattern based opponents. Also, remember to enter and use the same name each time you play so your progress is saved. Your name will get a special addition if you beat the final opponent.</p>
