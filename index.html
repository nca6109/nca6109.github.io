            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a software developer and game designer with a B.S. in Game Desgin and Development from the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am both a front and backend developer proficient in C#, C++, Javascript, and HTML/CSS and with experience working on websites, databases, and .NET applications. Additionally, I am an experienced game designer from my work on a variety of game projects and years of analyzing the variety of games I play. I also compose, produce, and integrate the soundtracks and effects for a lot of my games and projects. Aside from games and technology, I enjoy playing volleyball, being involved in music, and obsessing over whatever fictional world has piqued my intrigue recently (Star Wars and Attack on Titan are some favorites of mine). I am looking forward to a long career of software development and design and wherever that path may take me.</p>

                <div class="pDesc">I worked with a team of four others on a casual puzzle game based on Lawrence Watt-Evans' <em>Legends of Ethshar</em> novel series. Our game, <em>Captive's Call</em> is a tile based puzzle game built in Unity where the player can control up to four unique characters that all have a unique set of abilities. The player can use these abilities to traverse and manipulate the environment in levels to reach the exit. I was responsible for the majority of the gameplay and UI implementation in the game, the sound design and implementation, as well as creating some of the assets.

The game also contains a visual novel-esque hub room where the game's characters can be interacted with. I was responsible for all hub room controls, the dialogue system and some writing, and the sound design and implementation.

The team from my internship conceptualized and built the project during the summer of 2024. The site was developed with NextJS and the database backend with PostgreSQL and SequelizeJS. Over the course of the project I helped design the overall site's flow, design and build the database, implement API functionality into the front-end, and build the user functionality and services. The repository for Crowd Comic can be found <a href="https://github.com/RIT-Crowd-Comic" target="_blank">here</a> and the deployed site <a href="https://crowd-comic-site-07c5469f2ff1.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>

                <div class="pDesc"><p>I created an audio visualizer web app using music from and graphic's inspired by Monolithsoft's <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>. The visualizer has four different tracks that it can react to, a set of controls that can change how the app visualizes the music or changes the music itself, and an interactive canvas interface. While creating this web app I gained more experience working with JS Modules, drawing with Canvas, and audio anylysers.
